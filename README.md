# Car-price
Predictive modelling of price of a car:
The objective of this project is to build a model that predicts the price of a car given a set of features. Intuitively the target variable is the cost price of cars and this cost depends on various factors, out of which 21 of them are considered in this experiment. These factors serve as the regressor or independent variables and they are mentioned below.
Categorical variables:
1. Make
2. Fuel type
3. Aspiration
4. Num_of_doors
5. Body style
6. Drive wheels
7. Engine location
8. Engine type
9. Num_of_cylinders
10. Fuel system
Quantitative variables:
1. Wheel_base
2. Length
3. Width
4. Height
5. Curb_weight
6. Engine_size
7. Compression_ratio
8. Horsepower
9. Peak_rpm
10. City_mpg
11. Highway_mpg
Here, few algorithms like linear regression, ridge, lasso, SVM and decision trees are used to fit and predict the data. From them, a suitable model with better evaluation metrics is chosen and its parameters are fine tuned for obtaining best results.
